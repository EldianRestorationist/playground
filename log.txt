Today I watched several videos on using basics in VScode and Github. 
My goal is to push something to github everyday for practice.
I understand how to commit and push straight to git from vscode.
For now I would like to do it on the terminal until I am more familiar with the process.
If you start off the hard way, you learn more and it can only get easier.

Yesterday I took the day off to help heal up a personal injury.

Today I finished Fundamentals Part 3 on the JavaScript basics
in the Foundations. I am now 65% complete in Foundations.
I also created a folder for notes in  the playground repo.
