Today I watched several videos on using basics in VScode and Github. 
My goal is to push something to github everyday for practice.
I understand how to commit and push straight to git from vscode.
For now I would like to do it on the terminal until I am more familiar with the process.
If you start off the hard way, you learn more and it can only get easier.
